# AI Tic-Tac-Toe Agent

## Overview
This project implements an AI Tic-Tac-Toe agent capable of playing the classic game against a human player. The AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games, to determine the best possible move at each turn. The primary objective of this project is to provide an engaging and challenging gameplay experience for users while showcasing the capabilities of the Minimax algorithm in solving games with perfect information.

## Features
- AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay against a human player.
- Implements the Minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making.
- Provides a customizable game board size (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, etc.).
- Interactive user interface for seamless gameplay experience.
- Real-time feedback on game status, including win, loss, or draw outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Minimax Algorithm
- Tkinter (Python GUI library)

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the game using Python:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   Follow the on-screen instructions to start the game.
4. Choose the size of the game board (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, etc.).
5. Play against the AI Tic-Tac-Toe agent by selecting your moves on the game board.
6. The AI will respond with its moves based on the Minimax algorithm.
7. Continue playing until one player achieves victory or the game ends in a draw.
Example

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Tkinter library installed (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
Limitations
The AI's performance may vary based on the size of the game board and the depth of the Minimax search tree.
The implementation may not be optimized for extremely large game boards or deep search trees.
