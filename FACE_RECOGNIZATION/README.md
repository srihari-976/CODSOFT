# AI Face Recognition Interface

![Face Recognition](face_recognition_demo.gif)

## Overview
This project implements an AI interface capable of detecting and recognizing faces in images and videos. It utilizes pre-trained face detection models, such as Haarcascades, to identify faces within a given image or video stream. The primary objective of this project is to recognize specific faces, such as the user's face, within various media formats.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition in both images and videos.
- Utilizes pre-trained face detection models like Haarcascades.
- Ability to recognize specific faces, such as the user's face.
- Provides real-time feedback on detected faces.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haarcascades (Pre-trained face detection model)

## How to Use
1. Install Python on your system if you haven't already.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., OpenCV).
4. Prepare the images or videos you want to analyze.
5. Run the interface using Python:
   ```bash
   python face_recognition.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to select the media file and start the face detection and recognition process.
The interface will provide real-time feedback on detected faces, including any recognized faces, if applicable.
Example

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
OpenCV library installed (pip install opencv-python).
Limitations
The accuracy of face recognition heavily depends on the quality of the pre-trained models and the input media.
Performance may vary based on hardware capabilities and the complexity of the images or videos being analyzed.
